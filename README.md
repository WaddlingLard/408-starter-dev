# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

To run the website first open/clone the project repository using VSCode. After that, running the command "npm install" in the
console will then install any packages/dependencies that the project requires. Then, use the extension "Live Preview" on VSCode 
to view the website! Also, you can view the website through a web browser using "localhost:3000" while the extension is running.
