# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

To run the website, use the extension "Live Preview" on VSCode to view the website!
Also, you can view the website though a web browser using "localhost:3000" while the extension is running.

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
- jQuery: https://jquery.com/
- Background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/...
- Sound effects: https://freesound.org/people/...
- Icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- etc.
